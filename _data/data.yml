    summary: |
      Hi, my name is Robert and I am a data analyst who loves answering challenging questions and
      working with large data sets. I'm a naturally curious person who loves to ask questions that others haven't thought of before 
      and then exploring the different relationships between variables to search for answers.
      My experience in public speaking and team leadership makes working efficiently and communicating results 
      second nature. I'm excited to share with you the projects I have enjoyed working on throughout my career. Here, have a look!
